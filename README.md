# Steganography-Project
The proposed system uses digital image steganography to securely hide messages inside images without making them noticeable.
Unlike encryption, which makes the presence of confidential data obvious, this system ensures that sensitive information remains undetectable. A web-based interface makes it easy to use, allowing users to upload an image, enter a message, and encode it seamlessly. The system efficiently retrieves hidden messages without affecting image quality. It improves security, accessibility, and ease of use compared to existing steganography tools.
